# Water Animation

For my project I was attempting to recreate this scene:

Simply put I was aiming to simulate the flow of water into a glass. When re-creating the image I found that using a pure white background made the final image look to fake so I used a simple gradient which made the final image look much better. The other aspect that is different was I tried to create a wine glass but it proved too difficult so I instead created a normal cup to catch the water. The final image can be seen below, for a higher resolution image look at the sample.png file.

In addition I made a short animation of this scene, it can be viewed as water-animation.mp4. While I tried my best to make the water look as real as possible, there were some parts that did not look real enough. For instance the waves in the water that never go away in the later part of the animation. I could have fixed this by going and editing every frame of the animation but this did not seem practical, so I left is as is.
